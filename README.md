# Voice-Based Construction Bill Generator

## 🏗️ Project Overview
The **Voice-Based Construction Bill Generator** is a JavaScript-based application that allows construction professionals to generate bills using voice commands. It leverages **Speech Recognition API** and JavaScript to efficiently process inputs, calculate costs, and generate invoices in real-time.

## 🚀 Features
- 🎙️ **Voice Command Input** – Uses Speech-to-Text to convert spoken words into structured data.
- 📋 **Itemized Bill Generation** – Allows users to specify materials, labor costs, and other expenses.
- 📊 **Real-Time Calculation** – Automatically computes the total cost including taxes and discounts.
- 📄 **Export & Save** – Users can export invoices as **PDF/Excel** or print them.
- 🌐 **Web-Based** – Works directly in the browser with no installation required.
- 🔐 **User Authentication** – Secure login system (optional for cloud storage integration).

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Front-End:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Speech Recognition API:** Web Speech API (Google Chrome recommended)
- **Database (Optional):** Firebase / LocalStorage / IndexedDB
- **Exporting Tools:** jsPDF for PDF generation

## 📌 Installation & Setup
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ShashiShekharDixit/Voice-Based-Construction-Bill-Generator.git
   cd voice-bill-generator
   ```
2. **Open `index.html` in a browser** (Preferably Google Chrome for better Speech Recognition support).
3. **Enable microphone permissions** for speech input.
4. **Start using voice commands** to generate bills!

## 🎙️ How It Works
1. Click on the **Start Recording** button.
2. Speak out the materials, quantities, and labor costs.
3. The system processes the speech and fills in the bill form.
4. It calculates the **total cost automatically**.
5. Users can review, edit, and export the bill.
